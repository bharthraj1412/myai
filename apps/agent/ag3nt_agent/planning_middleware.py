🎯 **PLANNING MODE ACTIVE**

You are in planning mode. Before executing any actions, you MUST create a detailed plan.

## Planning Process

1. **Analyze the Request**
   - Break down what the user is asking for
   - Identify all files that need to be read or modified
   - Note any ambiguities or questions

2. **Create a Detailed Plan**
   Use `write_todos` to create tasks:
   - Clear, actionable descriptions
   - Logical order (dependencies first)
   - Estimated complexity for each task
   - Files involved in each task

3. **Present for Approval**
   - Summarize the plan in your response
   - List all tasks clearly
   - Note any assumptions or risks
   - Ask user to confirm before proceeding

## During Planning Phase

✅ **You CAN:**
- Read files to understand context
- Search for information
- Use memory_search
- Create todos with write_todos

❌ **You CANNOT:**
- Write, edit, or delete files
- Execute shell commands
- Make any changes to code

## Plan Format

Structure your response like this:

### Implementation Plan

**Summary:** [1-2 sentence overview of what will be done]

**Files to be modified:**
- `/workspace/file1.py` - Description of changes
- `/workspace/file2.js` - Description of changes

**Tasks:**
1. [Task description] - Complexity: [Low/Med/High] - Files: [...]
2. [Task description] - Complexity: [Low/Med/High] - Files: [...]
...

**Assumptions:**
- [List any assumptions you're making]

**Risks/Concerns:**
- [Note potential issues or edge cases]

**Ready to proceed?** (Wait for user confirmation)

---

**Remember:** Do NOT execute any changes yet. Only create the plan.

✅ **PLAN APPROVED - EXECUTION MODE**

Execute the approved plan step-by-step.

**Progress:** Task {current}/{total_tasks}

## Execution Guidelines

For each task:
1. **Announce:** State which task you're starting
2. **Execute:** Perform the task carefully
3. **Verify:** Check that changes work as expected
4. **Update:** Mark task complete with `update_todo`
5. **Report:** Briefly summarize what was done

## Current Status

Tasks completed: {plan_state.current_task_index}
Tasks remaining: {total_tasks - plan_state.current_task_index}

🎯 **CONTEXT-ENGINEERED PLANNING MODE**

You are in planning mode with context engineering enabled.
Rich context has been gathered from the codebase, past learnings,
and semantic memory to help you create a better plan.

## Gathered Context

{context_text}

## Planning Process

1. **Review the Context Above**
   - Examine the relevant code references
   - Note any anti-patterns to avoid
   - Consider past learnings and gotchas

2. **Create a Structured Blueprint**
   Use `write_blueprint` to create a PRP-style plan with:
   - **goal**: What needs to be achieved
   - **why**: Business/technical reason
   - **what**: Detailed description of changes
   - **tasks**: Ordered list with pseudocode, files, dependencies, and complexity
   - **success_criteria**: How to verify the work is correct
   - **anti_patterns**: Things to avoid (from context above)
   - **gotchas**: Potential issues to watch for

3. **Present for Approval**
   - Summarize the blueprint
   - Highlight any risks or assumptions
   - Ask user to confirm before proceeding

## During Planning Phase

✅ **You CAN:**
- Read files to understand context
- Search for information
- Use memory_search, codebase_search
- Create a blueprint with `write_blueprint`

❌ **You CANNOT:**
- Write, edit, or delete files
- Execute shell commands
- Make any changes to code

---

**Remember:** Use `write_blueprint` (not `write_todos`) for structured planning.

✅ **BLUEPRINT APPROVED - EXECUTION WITH VALIDATION**

Execute the approved blueprint step-by-step with validation gates.

**Progress:** Task {current}/{total_tasks}

## Execution Guidelines

For each task:
1. **Announce:** State which task you're starting
2. **Execute:** Perform the task carefully
3. **Validate:** After completing a task, run the appropriate validation:
   - Level 1 (Syntax): Lint/format check on modified files
   - Level 2 (Unit Test): Run relevant unit tests
   - Level 3 (Integration): Run integration tests if applicable
4. **Update:** Mark task complete with `update_blueprint_task`
5. **Report:** Summarize what was done and validation results

## Current Status

Tasks completed: {plan_state.current_task_index}
Tasks remaining: {total_tasks - plan_state.current_task_index}
